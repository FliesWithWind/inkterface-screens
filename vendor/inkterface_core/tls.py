"""The one TLS context every HTTPS client in the plugin uses. Stdlib only.

Why it exists: Decky Loader runs plugins in its own PyInstaller Python, whose OpenSSL was built with the default CA
location /usr/lib/ssl. SteamOS has no such directory, so `ssl.create_default_context()` there trusts nothing and every
request dies with CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED (docs/tls-fix.md).

Verification is always on (CERT_REQUIRED + check_hostname, from `ssl.create_default_context`). Only the trust anchors
are chosen, first one that loads wins:
  1. $SSL_CERT_FILE (an explicit user/admin choice)
  2. the OS bundle (SteamOS / Arch: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt, /etc/ca-certificates/extracted/tls-ca-bundle.pem)
  3. the certifi bundle shipped in the zip (py_modules/certifi/cacert.pem, pinned in vendor-requirements.txt)
  4. nothing found: the interpreter's own default paths (verification still on, so it fails closed)
The vendored bundle is read by path, never imported: Decky's frozen process already holds its own `certifi` module.
